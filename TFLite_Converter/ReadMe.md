# TFLite_Converter

There are two ways to convert a Frozen_graph file generated by the transfer learning process into a Tensorflow Lite model (.lite or .tflite).<br/>
A python file convert_tflite.py is provided, just python it with correct path that contains a pb file.
The other way is to run the command line in the text file pb_tflite.txt .
