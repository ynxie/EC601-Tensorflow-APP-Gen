We used dogs-vs-cats dataset from kaggle for deep learning. The link which can download the dataset from [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). The original dataset includes 12499 pictures for cats and 12499 pictures for dogs in training set. However, to adjust our project, we just randomly select 64, 128, 512 and 1024 pictures for each categories as our original dataset. And we set 40%, 40% and 20% for training set, validation set and testing set in our process of transfer learning. The quality of the original data is pretty good. It has a large number of pictures and the pictures are so comprehensive. However, because we only select a small part of the data. And during our project, we find that the selecting of the original data has a huge influence on the accuracy of our APP. In order words, we need to select a small but comprehensive dataset for training to guarantee the accuracy of final APP.
